    "\n",
    "For this assignment, you will be using data from the [Progresa program](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oportunidades), a government social assistance program in Mexico. This program, as well as the details of its impact, are described in the paper \"[School subsidies for the poor: evaluating the Mexican Progresa poverty program](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304387803001858)\", by Paul Shultz (available on Canvas). Please familiarize yourself with the PROGRESA program before beginning this problem set, so you have a rough sense of where the data come from and how they were generated. If you just proceed into the problem set without understanding Progresa or the data, it will be very difficult!\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this problem set is to implement some of the basic econometric techniques that you are learning in class to measure the impact of Progresa on secondary school enrollment rates. The timeline of the program was:\n",

    " * Baseline survey conducted in 1997\n",
    " * Intervention begins in 1998, \"Wave 1\" of data collected in 1998\n",
    " * \"Wave 2 of data\" collected in 1999\n",
    " * Evaluation ends in 2000, at which point the control villages were treated. \n",

    "When you are ready, download the progresa_sample.csv data from Canvas. The data are actual data collected to evaluate the impact of the Progresa program.
