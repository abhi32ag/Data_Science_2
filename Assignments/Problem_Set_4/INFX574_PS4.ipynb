    "This is a fun but challenging problem set. It will test your python skills, as well as your understanding of the material in class and in the readings. Start early and debug often! Some notes:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Part 1 is meant to be easy, so get through it quickly.\n",
    "* Part 2 (especially 2.1) will be difficult, but it is the lynchpin of this problem set to make sure to do it well and understand what you've done. If you find your gradient descent algorithm is taking more than a few minutes to complete, debug more, compare notes with others, and go to the TA sessions.\n",
    "* Depending on how well you've done 2.1, parts 2.3 and 4.3 will be relatively painless or incredibly painful. \n",
    "* Part 4 (especially 3.3) will be computationally intensive. Don't leave this until the last minute, otherwise your code might be running when the deadline arrives.\n",

Do this by first (a) regressing the housing price on the number of rooms per house, and then (b) regressing the housing price on the number of rooms per house and the (number of rooms per house) squared.
